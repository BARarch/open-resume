Here are my top 3:
The California Report
California is still the best example of a Progressive American Utopia.  Not completly from a really from the cultural or political standpoint, but more from a technological one.  The population Los Angeles basin was limited by the amount of water that could be pumped over the San Gabriel Mts for decades.  The degree and scale of civil utility development, infractructue and engineering is on another level.  Electricity is at minimum more efficient in transit by a factor of 2 compared to states.  The pioneers of the land had to be opportunistic and forward thinking.  This is still a quality that's strong in the collective mentality of the region today, from its passions to industries.  I hear this mentality in the voices and perspectives of the broadcasters, interviews and podcast guests.  I find it very refreshing, calming in stressful times.

The War On Cars
The American consumerist lore is often something that influences our American experience in general, nontheless our media.  In the opinion of the content creators, the automobile is a regressive, inefficient and destructive mode of transportation that citizens in the US rely on out of compulsion.  As an urban planner I listen for what is said about the impact the automobile infrastructure has on urbanism and how people interact with cities.

GO TIME!
As an internet researcher I handle lots of assignments using computer and internet tools.  GO, commonly referred to as Golang, is a new powerful language.  What I like from the content producers is their focus on applications for this new computer language.  The excitement is legitimate, not just vague.
