Anthony Quivers
Production Specialist

Hello and Good Afternoon,

I've come across your post for this job on Upwork, am I'm exited to see this.

I am an infographic designer, coder, and craftsmen (small furniture, lighting, interiors).  My consultancy work span industries from construction to floristry.  I make the best out of graphical technical tools, and enjoy finding an elegant graphic (or two) to illustrate a point!  What I offer is extensive knowledge and ability in the adobe stack for production and print design.  This includes skill with 3D modeling tools such as RHINOCEROS, PROCESSING and MAYA for visualizations and maps.  My personal style biases towards color, pop, or even playfulness, although I can produce genres that are concise and professional.  I am sure I can tailor my tastes to meet the culture of your studio and audience.

Attached are some of my grad school samples, as well as spreads from a data and culture blog that I am starting.  Let's set up a time to talk so we can discuss what you are doing, and get ideas flowing!

I really look forward to hearing from you.

Best Regards,

Anthony Quivers
