Hello and Good Morning,

I've come across your post for this job on Upwork, and am exited to see this! 

I am machine learning specialist, and fairly new to the platform.  From what I a, the problem you are looking to solve involves logistics and process automation. In the past I have solved logistical optimization problems. Often times I've used algorithms to optimize the flow and allocation of work across resources in a closed system. In my last role I custom wrote a script to assign delivery routes to drivers, as the number of drivers and order locations change on a daily basis. 

It looks like you have logistics optimization problem.  One that is similar in nature to the ones I handle regularly.  I am an algorithm developer with a notable career in writing data processing applications to produce spreadsheets, csv files, and databases.  From what I'm gathering from your post, you need a resource allocation style algorithm.  A script that OPTIMALLY assigns jobs to bays based on a projected completion time and maybe complexity too.  From a script I can produce the desired instructions in spreadsheet, as well as future optimized spreadsheets, based on what we learn.  

If you have time please have a look at:
 
https://leetcode.com/problems/possible-bipartition/solutions/2937505/first-attempt-at-backtracking-and-recursion-in-golang/.  

This is an example of a script that I did that is similar to what you want, but not exactly.  It is an algorithm that automatically assigns groups to people based on if they do not like others.  This may sound vague, however it is a very difficult problem with borderline cases that are hard to catch.  Your problem has similar conditions.  They are tricky and need special attention as they may lead to problems later on.  I have techniques to produce the best results for your assignments no matter how many borderline case you have. 

I really hope we can talk about this so I can explain to you my process in more detail.  It will work out really well if done right.  You will need to identify and address those borderline cases.  I can produce an optimal solution.  Feel free to contact me, let's talk soon.

Best Regards,

Hello and Good Morning,

I found your post on Upwork.  It looks like you are doing an exiting project on YouTube with automation and content!  My experience
in developing data processing scripts my be well suited to deliver your solution within your budget and in reasonable time.  I look forward to hearing from you learn what your approach is and what you have already started.  It sounds like an exiting project, and I have experience with the YouTube API.

I do python scripting and automation with algorithm and APIs.
