Dear Hearst Journalism Fellowship Program -Developer Track Representative,

Apologies for the late application.  I was made aware of this program from a mentor and friend this afternoon.
I am truly honored to have an opportunity to work within this group!  I seek to learn and grow in the media industry.

A little about me-
As a freelance software engineer and data visualization specialist, I bring extensive experience as an analyst though the use of digital and internet research tools.  I have a passion for data in media content.  On the side, I do competitive coding.  

I like to do those software interview questions, and see it as kind of a sport! 

Currently, I'm in the process of starting a blog and video channel for algorithm and data structure coding solutions.    

You can see my repo of coding solutions:

You can see my commentary on solutions for samples of my writing.

...and visit my twitch channel

Your consideration of my candidacy to this internship post is greatly appreciated.  Please contact me if you have any questions.  I look forward to hearing from you.

Best Regards,
Anthony Quivers
