My experience has provided me with necessary technical skills and abilities.  I hope to successfully execute solutions across a wide range of roles in the transport industries.  

I have refined my strengths through seven years of experience in both the floral, and construction industries.  The following is a snapshot of my broader technical skills:

Warehouse Management and Construction
Floral Goods Processing and Storage
Merchandising
Task Management 
Work Flow Modeling
Safety and Code Assessments
Electronic and Electrical Engineering 

It would be a pleasure to learn more about this industry and become trained to operate the machinery of the business. Should you have any questions feel free to contact me.  I would welcome the chance to provide further insight for how I can meet your requirements.

Once again, thank you for considering my candidacy for this position. I hope to hear from you soon to schedule an interview. 

Sincerely,

Anthony J. Quivers
